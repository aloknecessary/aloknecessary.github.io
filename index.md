## Hi, I’m Alok

I am a **Solution Architect** with deep, hands-on experience across **full-stack engineering, cloud architecture, DevOps, and system design**. I have grown from an individual contributor into a technical leader who architects, builds, reviews, and scales production-grade systems.

My work focuses on translating **business problems into pragmatic, scalable, and cost-efficient technical solutions**. I believe strong architecture is driven by clarity, resilience, and long-term maintainability—not unnecessary complexity.

## What I Do

- Architect and deliver **end-to-end systems** spanning frontend, backend, infrastructure, and integrations  
- Design **cloud-native architectures** with a focus on reliability, security, and cost optimization  
- Lead system design discussions, estimations, and architectural decision-making  
- Mentor engineers and collaborate closely with product, UX, and business stakeholders  
- Reducing operational risk and technical debt

## Professional Experience

### **[Byteridge Software Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.byteridge.com)**   
*Solution Architect* **|**
*2014 – Present*

For over a decade at Byteridge, I’ve grown from a hands-on engineer into a solution and architecture owner, shaping complex, production-grade systems across the full stack. My role focuses on translating real business problems into pragmatic, scalable, and resilient technical solutions.

I’ve led and delivered systems that integrate frontend, backend, infrastructure, and cloud products — blending architectural rigor with software engineering craftsmanship. My work spans:
- Full-stack application design using React, Angular, Node.js, and .NET.
- Modular, API-centric platforms with strong authentication, observability, and integration patterns.
- Cloud-native architectures with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

A core part of my role involves collaborating with product, UX, and business stakeholders to drive clarity and alignment, as well as mentoring engineers through system design and implementation decisions.

Byteridge continues to be the foundation where I’ve built my engineering philosophy — pragmatic, resilient, and continuously evolving systems that solve real problems.

## Philosophy

> *“Making mistakes is better than faking perfection.”*

I value transparency, thoughtful experimentation, and learning through execution. Real systems improve through iteration—not theory alone.
