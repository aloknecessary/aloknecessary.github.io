## Hi, I’m Alok

I am a **Solution Architect** with deep, hands-on experience across **full-stack engineering, cloud architecture, DevOps, and system design**. I have grown from an individual contributor into a technical leader who architects, builds, reviews, and scales production-grade systems.

My work focuses on translating **business problems into pragmatic, scalable, and cost-efficient technical solutions**. I believe strong architecture is driven by clarity, resilience, and long-term maintainability—not unnecessary complexity.

## What I Do

- Architect and deliver **end-to-end systems** spanning frontend, backend, infrastructure, and integrations  
- Design **cloud-native architectures** with a focus on reliability, security, and cost optimization  
- Lead system design discussions, estimations, and architectural decision-making  
- Mentor engineers and collaborate closely with product, UX, and business stakeholders  
- Reducing operational risk and technical debt

## Core Expertise

### Architecture & Platforms
- Microservices & Distributed Systems
- Kubernetes (AKS), Docker, Container Security
- Cloud Architecture (AWS & Azure)
- API Design & Integration Patterns
- Modular, scalable, domain-driven systems

### Engineering
- Building and maintaining **full-stack applications** using **React, Angular, Node.js, and .NET**, with clear separation of concerns and scalable design
- Designing and consuming **RESTful APIs**, including authentication/authorization flows, **SSO integrations**, and well-documented interfaces using **Swagger / OpenAPI**
- Implementing **event-driven and asynchronous systems**, including background workers, message-based workflows, and long-running process orchestration
- Integrating and managing **third-party services and external APIs**, ensuring reliability, error handling, and observability
- Driving **performance optimization and scalability** through efficient API design, **caching strategies**, and containerized deployments using **Docker**

### DevOps & Operations
- Designing and implementing **robust CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions for repeatable, reliable deployments
- Applying **Infrastructure as Code principles** to enable consistency, scalability, and environment parity
- Ensuring **production readiness** through structured release strategies and operational safeguards
- Establishing **observability standards** covering logging, metrics, and alerting for faster incident response
- Improving system reliability via **operational automation, failure analysis, and continuous improvement**

### Data & Persistence
- Selecting **appropriate data models and storage technologies** based on access patterns, consistency, and domain needs
- Designing for **scalability and clarity** through separation of transactional and analytical workloads
- Ensuring **data integrity and evolution** via schema versioning, backward compatibility, and governance practices
- Optimizing data performance using **indexing, query tuning, and lifecycle management**
- Building resilient data platforms with **backup, restore, and disaster recovery strategies**

### Cost Optimization
- Designing **cost-aware cloud and Kubernetes architectures** using real workload telemetry, autoscaling, and right-sized infrastructure
- Eliminating waste through **resource optimization, idle environment cleanup, and CI/CD build caching strategies**
- Balancing **performance, resilience, and cost** through explicit architectural trade-off analysis
- Applying **FinOps principles** to improve cost visibility, accountability, and decision-making across teams
- Continuously refining infrastructure based on **usage patterns, growth trends, and operational feedback**

## Philosophy

> *“Making mistakes is better than faking perfection.”*

I value transparency, thoughtful experimentation, and learning through execution. Real systems improve through iteration—not theory alone.
