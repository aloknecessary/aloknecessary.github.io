# Personal Website & Technical Blog

This repository contains the source code and content for my personal website and technical blog, built using **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

The site serves as a central place for:
- Professional background and architectural experience
- In-depth technical writing and engineering insights
- Reference implementations and supporting code for blog posts

The repository follows a content-first structure with a strong focus on clarity, maintainability, and long-term evolution.
