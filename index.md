## Hi, I’m Alok

I am a **Solution Architect** with deep, hands-on experience across **full-stack engineering, cloud architecture, DevOps, and system design**. I have grown from an individual contributor into a technical leader who architects, builds, reviews, and scales production-grade systems.

My work focuses on translating **business problems into pragmatic, scalable, and cost-efficient technical solutions**. I believe strong architecture is driven by clarity, resilience, and long-term maintainability—not unnecessary complexity.

## What I Do

- Architect and deliver **end-to-end systems** spanning frontend, backend, infrastructure, and integrations  
- Design **cloud-native architectures** with a focus on reliability, security, and cost optimization  
- Lead system design discussions, estimations, and architectural decision-making  
- Mentor engineers and collaborate closely with product, UX, and business stakeholders

## Philosophy

> *“Making mistakes is better than faking perfection.”*

I value transparency, thoughtful experimentation, and learning through execution. Real systems improve through iteration—not theory alone.
